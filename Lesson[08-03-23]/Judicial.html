            <h2>Judicial branch of the Philippine Government</h2>
            <p>The Judicial branch of the Philippine Government is responsible for interpreting laws, settling legal
                disputes, and
                ensuring that justice is upheld. It is independent of the Executive and Legislative branches to ensure a
                system of
                checks and balances. The primary duty of the judiciary is to uphold the rule of law and safeguard the
                rights and
                liberties of the Filipino people.</p>

            <section>

                <h3>Structure of the Judicial Branch:</h3>
                <p>The highest court in the Philippines is the Supreme Court, which serves as the apex of the judicial
                    system. It is
                    composed of the Chief Justice and fourteen Associate Justices. The Supreme Court is located in
                    Manila and has the
                    authority to decide on cases of national significance and constitutional importance.</p>
                <p>Below the Supreme Court, there are several lower courts organized in a hierarchical manner:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Court of Appeals:</strong>The Court of Appeals (CA) is an intermediate appellate court.
                        It reviews decisions and final orders of Regional Trial
                        Courts (RTCs) and other lower courts. The CA has multiple divisions, each composed of three
                        justices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sandiganbayan:</strong>The Sandiganbayan is a special court that handles cases involving
                        graft and corrupt practices committed by public
                        officials, including those with a salary grade of 27 and higher, and their accomplices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Court of Tax Appeals:</strong>The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) has jurisdiction over
                        tax-related cases, particularly those involving disputes between
                        taxpayers and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC).</li>
                    <li><strong>Regional Trial Courts:</strong>The Regional Trial Courts (RTCs) are the main trial
                        courts in the Philippines. They handle criminal and civil cases, as
                        well as certain special cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Municipal Trial Courts:</strong>Municipal Trial Courts (MTCs) and Municipal Circuit
                        Trial Courts (MCTCs) have limited jurisdiction over less serious
                        offenses and civil cases within their territorial jurisdiction.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

                <h3>Powers and Functions of the Judicial Branch:</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Judicial Review:</strong>The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review, allowing it
                        to interpret the Constitution and determine the
                        constitutionality of laws, executive orders, and other government actions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adjudication:</strong>The judiciary hears and decides on various cases, including civil,
                        criminal, and administrative matters, brought before
                        the courts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule-Making:</strong>The Supreme Court can promulgate rules concerning the protection
                        and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading,
                        practice, and procedure in all courts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Appointment of Judges:</strong>The President appoints judges to the lower courts based
                        on a list of qualified nominees prepared by the Judicial and Bar
                        Council (JBC).</li>
                    <li><strong>Administrative Supervision:</strong>The Supreme Court exercises administrative
                        supervision over all lower courts and personnel to ensure efficient court
                        operations and adherence to ethical standards.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Role in the Philippine Government:</h3>
                <p>The Judicial branch acts as the guardian of the Constitution and the protector of individual rights.
                    It provides a
                    mechanism for resolving disputes and ensuring that laws are interpreted and applied consistently and
                    fairly. By
                    maintaining an independent judiciary, the Philippine government aims to uphold the rule of law and
                    protect the rights
                    and liberties of its citizens.

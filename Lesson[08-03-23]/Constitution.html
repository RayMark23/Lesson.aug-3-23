                <h2>Philippine Constitution</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The current Constitution of the Philippines was ratified on February 2, 1987. It replaced the previous
                1973 Constitution
                and has since served as the fundamental law of the land. The Constitution outlines the structure of the
                government,
                defines the rights and responsibilities of citizens, and establishes the framework for the rule of law
                and the country's
                democratic system.</p>

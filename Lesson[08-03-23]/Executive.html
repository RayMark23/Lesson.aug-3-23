                <h2>Executive branch of the Philippine Government</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The Executive branch of the Philippine Government is one of the three branches, along with the
                Legislative and Judicial
                branches. It is responsible for implementing and enforcing laws, executing government policies, and
                managing the
                day-to-day affairs of the country. At the head of the Executive branch is the President of the
                Philippines, who serves
                as both the head of state and the head of government.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>President of the Philippines:</h3>
                <p>The President is elected by popular vote and can serve a single six-year term without the possibility
                    of reelection. To
                    be eligible for the presidency, a candidate must be a natural-born Filipino citizen, at least 40
                    years old on the day of
                    the election, able to read and write, and a registered voter.</p>
                <h3>Powers and Responsibilities of the President:</h3>

                    <li><strong>Chief Legislator:</strong>Although the President cannot directly make laws, they can

                    <li><strong>Emergency Powers:</strong>In times of crisis or national emergency, the President may be

            <section>
                <h3>Vice President of the Philippines:</h3>
                <p>The Vice President is the second-highest official in the country and is elected separately from the
                    President. In the
                    event of a vacancy in the office of the President, the Vice President assumes the presidency.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Cabinet:</h3>
                <p>The President is assisted by the Cabinet, composed of department secretaries and heads of executive
                    departments. The
                    Cabinet advises the President on matters of national interest and helps implement government
                    policies and programs.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Executive Departments:</h3>
                <p>The Philippines has various executive departments, each headed by a secretary appointed by the
                    President. These
                    departments are responsible for specific areas of governance, such as finance, defense, education,
                    health,
                    transportation, and more.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Independent Constitutional Commissions:</h3>
                <p>Although not directly part of the Executive branch, the President has no control over independent
                    constitutional
                    commissions. These include the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), the Civil Service Commission
                    (CSC), and the Commission
                    on Audit (COA). They have distinct functions and operate independently to ensure checks and balances
                    within the
                    government.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, the Executive branch plays a crucial role in governing the Philippines and implementing the
                    laws and policies
                    that impact the nation's development and well-being.

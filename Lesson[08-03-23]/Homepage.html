                <h2>The Philippine Government</h2>
            </header>
            <p>As of my last update in September 2021, the Philippine government is a democratic republic with a
                multi-tiered
                system of
                governance. It operates under a constitution that was ratified in 1987 after the fall of the Marcos
                dictatorship. The
                government is divided into three branches: the Executive, the Legislative, and the Judicial.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Executive Branch:</strong><br>The President of the Philippines serves as the head of state
                    and government and is elected by popular
                    vote
                    for a single
                    six-year term. The President is responsible for implementing and enforcing laws, as well as
                    overseeing
                    the
                    day-to-day
                    administration of the government. The Vice President is also elected separately from the President
                    and
                    serves as the
                    second-highest official in the country.<br><br></li>

                <li><strong>Legislative Branch:</strong><br>The Philippine Congress is a bicameral body consisting of
                    the Senate and the House of
                    Representatives.
                    The
                    Senate has 24
                    members elected nationwide for a six-year term, while the House of Representatives is composed of
                    representatives from
                    different districts and party-list groups elected for three-year terms. The Congress is responsible
                    for
                    enacting laws
                    and exercising legislative power.<br><br></li>

                <li><strong>Judicial Branch:</strong><br>The Philippine judiciary is independent and tasked with
                    interpreting the laws and ensuring their
                    constitutionality. The
                    Supreme Court is the highest judicial body in the country and is headed by the Chief Justice. There
                    are
                    also
                    lower
                    courts, such as the Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Courts, to handle various levels of
                    cases.<br><br>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Local Government:</strong><br>The Philippines is divided into administrative regions and
                    provinces, cities, municipalities, and
                    barangays
                    (the
                    smallest political unit). Each level of local government has its own officials who are elected by
                    the
                    people.
                    <br><br>
                    The Philippines follows a multi-party system, with various political parties competing in elections.
                    The
                    major political
                    parties include the Liberal Party, Nationalist People's Coalition, Nacionalista Party, and Partido
                    Demokratiko
                    Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban), among others.
                    <br><br>
                    It's important to note that the political landscape and the government structure may have evolved or
                    undergone changes
                    since my last update in 2021. For the most current information, it's recommended to refer to
                    reliable
                    and
                    up-to-date
                    sources.

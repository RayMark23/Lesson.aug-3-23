                <h2>Legislative branch of the Philippine</h2>
            </header>
            <p>As of my last update in September 2021, the Legislative branch of the Philippine Government is a
                bicameral body known
                as
                the Congress of the Philippines. It is responsible for making and passing laws, representing the
                people's interests,
                and
                exercising oversight over the executive branch. The Congress plays a vital role in the democratic
                process and the
                governance of the country.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>Bicameral Structure:</h3>
                <p>The Congress of the Philippines is composed of two chambers:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Senate:</strong>The Senate is the upper chamber of Congress and is composed of 24
                        senators. Each senator serves a six-year term, and
                        they are elected nationwide through a national vote. The Senate represents the entire country,
                        and its members are
                        expected to have a broader national perspective.</li>
                    <li><strong>House of Representatives:</strong>The House of Representatives is the lower chamber of
                        Congress and is composed of representatives from legislative
                        districts and party-list groups. There are 80 legislative districts in the country, each
                        represented by one
                        representative. Party-list groups, on the other hand, represent marginalized sectors and are
                        elected through a separate
                        nationwide vote. Representatives in the House serve three-year terms.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Powers and Responsibilities:</h3>
                <p>The Congress of the Philippines has various powers and responsibilities, including:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Legislation:</strong>The primary function of Congress is to make laws. Both the Senate
                        and the House of Representatives can propose, amend,
                        and pass bills into law. For a bill to become law, it must pass both chambers and be signed by
                        the President.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oversight:</strong>Congress exercises oversight over the executive branch, including
                        government agencies and departments, to ensure that
                        they are performing their functions properly and efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confirmation and Appointments:</strong>The Senate has the power to confirm appointments
                        made by the President, including Cabinet members, ambassadors, and
                        other high-ranking government officials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impeachment:</strong>The House of Representatives has the exclusive power to initiate
                        impeachment proceedings against the President, Vice
                        President, members of the Supreme Court, and other impeachable officials. The Senate then acts
                        as the impeachment court
                        that tries and decides on the impeachment cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Budget and Appropriations:</strong>Congress has the authority to approve the national
                        budget, ensuring that government funds are allocated to various
                        programs and projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Treaties and International Agreements:</strong>The Senate has the power to concur in
                        treaties and international agreements negotiated by the President.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Congressional Sessions:</h3>
                <p>Congress holds regular sessions beginning on the fourth Monday of July and ending on the third Monday
                    of June of the
                    following year. It may also hold special sessions when called by the President to address urgent
                    matters.</p>

                <h3>Congressional Districts and Party-List System:</h3>
                <p>The Philippines is divided into legislative districts, each represented by a member of the House of
                    Representatives.
                    Additionally, the party-list system allows marginalized and underrepresented sectors to have seats
                    in the House based on
                    their share of the total national vote.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>The Legislative branch, composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives, plays a crucial role
                    in the governance
                    of the Philippines. It exercises the power of lawmaking, provides checks and balances over the
                    executive branch, and
                    represents the diverse interests of the Filipino people.
